			<p class="Text"><span class="Text---trailhead-name">Lower Burrell trailhead: MPzero (40.6201264,-79.7048475) - </span>Take PA 28 to the Tarentum/New Kensington Exit (exit 14). Exit east bound on PA 366. In about a mile you will cross the Tarentum Bridge. From the end of the bridge go 0.6 miles to Leechburg Road and turn left/east on Leechburg Road In about a mile Leechburg Road will bend right at Edgecliff Road. Take the left hand turn onto Edgecliff Road. Go 0.8 miles and turn left at the Tee to stay on Edgecliff Road where Garver Ferry Road starts on the right. Bear right when Edgecliff road gets to the river and changes name to Lowe Road.  Follow Lowe Road along the river, past the lock and dam. Stay on Lowe road when it bends right away from the river where straight is “No Outlet”. About a block after the bend turn left on Arnold, just after the fire station. Just past Boggs Street, continue to follow the road (now deteriorating) as it bends left then right past a garage. Continue on this unpromising road past some trailers and docks for about a half mile. There you will see a sign for the trail head and parking.</p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="Text---trailhead-name">Freeport Bridge Trailhead:  MP3.6 (40.6667547,-79.6910292) - </span>Take PA28 to the Freeport/Millerstown exit #16. Turn right/east at the end of the ramp. Go 0.6 miles to the tee and turn left/northwest onto Freeport Rd. Go 0.7 miles and turn right/south across Allegheny River on the Freeport bridge. Go 0.6 miles and shortly after crossing the bridge take a right/southwest onto River Landing Drive. Go 50 feet and take another right to go downhill along side the bridge. Continue downhill to the trailhead parking lot. </p>
			<p class="Text"><span class="Text---trailhead-name">Garver Ferry Road Trailhead: MP2.0 (40.6455407,-79.6851813) -</span> Not recommended because of the steepness and condition of the trail. Take PA 28 to the Tarentum/New Kensington Exit (exit 14). Exit east bound on PA 366. In about a mile you will cross the Tarentum Bridge. From the end of the bridge go 0.6 miles to Leechburg Road and turn left/east on Leechburg Road In about a mile Leechburg Road will bend right at Edgecliff Road. Take the left hand turn onto Edgecliff Road. Go 0.8 miles and turn right at the Tee onto Garver Ferry Road. Go about 0.3 miles and bear left where Wildlife Lodge Road comes in from the right. In about 4 miles turn left onto McCane Hollow Road. There is a trail sign on the left, however it is pointed the opposite direction from your travel and is therefore easy to miss. The intersection is a short distance up the hill as you begin to climb out of a dip in the road. The trailhead is about 0.1 miles down McCane Road.  There is space for only 2 or 3 cars at the trail head, so you may want to park along McCane Road, shortly after the turn off. Be careful not to block or clutter up any driveways, access roads or gates. This gate is the only way for an emergency vehicle to get access to the trail.</p>
